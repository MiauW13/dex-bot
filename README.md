# Ergo-Dex offchain-bot without docker
This guidence come from my own issue which is i want to run the Dex offchain bot on the mechine that cannot suport docker, maybe someone out there have same problem as I did, and want to run offchain bot without docker

I only try this methode only on linux and maybe it will work on windows where Wsl had been installed and using it to run the script



# Prerequisites

there are some requirment before we can run our script and make the bot working
  1. GIT to download the script from here
